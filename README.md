üöÄ Project 1: Delivery Route Optimization (Travelling Salesman Problem - TSP)

Overview
This project addresses delivery route optimization using the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The objective is to determine the shortest path for a delivery worker visiting multiple customer locations.

Implementation
The solution is implemented using four different algorithms:

Nearest Neighbour Algorithm (Greedy approach using Euclidean distance)
Held-Karp Algorithm (Dynamic Programming)
Genetic Algorithm (Metaheuristic approach)
Brute Force (Exact approach)
Results & Insights
The Nearest Neighbour approach is computationally efficient but may not always yield the optimal solution.
The Held-Karp Algorithm guarantees an optimal solution but has a high computational cost.
The Genetic Algorithm balances performance and accuracy.
The Brute Force method finds the best path but is impractical for large datasets.
üìç Key Takeaway: TSP solutions are invaluable in logistics, supply chain management, and delivery route planning.
